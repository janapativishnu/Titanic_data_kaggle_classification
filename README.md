# Titanic_data_kaggle_classification
This repository is for classifying Kaggle's Tatanic survivors data

Here I am using Scikit-Learn module's linear SVM classifier to classify the passenger's survived on The Titanic Mishap

Part of the code was commented mainly to devide data in train.csv into a training set and a cross-validation set which was used to optimize the parameters of the model before testing the model with the unlabel data (test.csv)
